Course IT 114 (Fall 2023) - Toegel_MC
Hello, my name is Het Patel, and I'm a second-year IT student planning to focus on game design.
I enjoy playing video games and taking walks. 
Because I enjoy the feeling of things coming together when working on a project, 
I am also quite interested in the programming learning process.
